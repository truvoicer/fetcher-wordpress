Users are core to WordPress and are a first class citizen in the WPGraphQL Schema. On this page we
will look at various ways to interact with Users using WPGraphQL.

## Queries

WPGraphQL comes with RootQuery fields built-in to query User data. You can query for lists of users
or individual users. Below, we'll look at some common examples for querying Users.

### List of Users

In this example, we query a list of User nodes. By default, WPGraphQL will return 10 items.

<GraphiQL
	query="
    query GET_USERS {
      users {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
    "
/>

<Note title="What's up with edges and nodes?" type="info">
One of the first things you may ask when you see this is: <strong><em>"What in the world are
'edges' and 'nodes'?"</em></strong>.

We've written up a guide on what they are and why WPGraphQL makes use of this shape of data
throughout.

### Connected Data

In WordPress, Users can be connected to Posts and Pages as the author. You can query a user's
connected data in various ways.

Here's one example, where we query for a list of users, and for each user we ask for a list of their
recent posts (default will be 10 most recent)

<GraphiQL
	query="
    query GET_USERS {
      users {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            name
            posts {
              nodes {
                id
                title
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    "
/>

### Single User

If we know the ID of a user, we can query for it like so:

<GraphiQL
	query='
    query GET_USER {
      user(id:"dXNlcjo2") {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    '
/>

## Mutations

WPGraphQL also supports mutations for users.

### Register User

For sites that have new user registrations enabled (under the WP-Admin Settings > General), a `registerUser` mutation will allow new users
to register via a GraphQL Mutation.

<GraphiQL
	query="
    mutation REGISTER_USER($input: RegisterUserInput!) {
      registerUser(input: $input) {
        user {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
    "
	variables={{
		input: {
			clientMutationId: "RegisterUser",
			username: "newUsername",
			email: "email@test.com",
		},
	}}
/>

### Create User

The `createUser` mutation is different than the `registerUser` mutation, because it requires the
request to be authenticated and for the user to have proper capabilities to create users, much
like if a user were to create another user from the WP-Admin dashboard.

<GraphiQL
	query="
    mutation CREATE_USER($input: CreateUserInput!) {
      createUser(input: $input) {
        user {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
    "
	variables={{
		input: {
			clientMutationId: "CreateUser",
			username: "anotherNewUser",
			email: "another_email@test.com",
		},
	}}
/>

### Update User

Below is an example of updating a user. The request must be authenticated and the user making
the request must have proper capabilities to edit the user being updated.

<GraphiQL
	query="
    mutation UPDATE_USER($input: UpdateUserInput!) {
      updateUser(input: $input) {
        user {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
    "
	variables={{
		input: {
			clientMutationId: "UpdateUser",
			id: "dXNlcjoxMg==",
			firstName: "Updated First Name",
		},
	}}
/>

### Delete User

Below is an example of deleting a user. The request must be authenticated and the user making the
request must have proper capabilities to delete the user.

<GraphiQL
	query="
    mutation DELETE_USER($input: DeleteUserInput!) {
      deleteUser(input: $input) {
        deletedId
      }
    }
    "
	variables={{
		input: {
			clientMutationId: "DeleteUser",
			id: "dXNlcjoxMg==",
		},
	}}
/>

### Send Password Reset Email

When a user needs to reset their password, they'll need to have a Reset Password email sent.

This mutation allows for a user to request that email:

<GraphiQL
	query="
    mutation SEND_PASSWORD_RESET_EMAIL($input: SendPasswordResetEmailInput!) {
      sendPasswordResetEmail(input: $input) {
        user {
          id
          email
        }
      }
    }
    "
	variables={{
		input: {
			clientMutationId: "SendResetPasswordEmail",
			username: "billybob",
		},
	}}
/>

### Reset User Password

The email that is sent to a user to reset their password contains a unique key that grants them
access to reset the password.

If that key is entered along with the matching username and a new password, the password can be reset.

<GraphiQL
	query="
    mutation RESET_USER_PASSWORD($input: ResetUserPasswordInput!) {
      resetUserPassword(input: $input) {
        user {
          id
        }
      }
    }
    "
	variables={{
		input: {
			clientMutationId: "ResetUserPassword",
			key: "theKeyFromTheEmail",
			login: "billybob",
			password: "vw8TfH9Q94z0",
		},
	}}
/>

## Sensitive Data

WordPress considers users with published content of a public post type public entities. Users that
do not have published content in a public post type are considered private.

This means that a public GraphQL request can query for users and get a list of users in response. Much
like a user could visit a published author's archive page or see the Username in the byline of
a Blog Post. User that do not have any published content will not be returned in the results of a
non-authenticated GraphQL query for users.

Some fields, such as the `User.email` are restricted and will return `null` if the request is a
non-authenticated request.

### Restricting fields

In certain cases, you may want to restrict specific fields to authenticated requests or other criteria.

The below snippet shows one way (of many possible ways) to filter WPGraphQL field resolvers to restrict
the values of specific fields from resolving if the user is not logged in. You can use this snippet
as inspiration to filter specific fields of specific Types that you would like to restrict based
on whatever custom criteria your application has.


```php
add_action( 'graphql_register_types', function() {

	/**
	 * Define the Types and their Fields that we want to filter
	 */
	$fields_to_require_auth = [
		'User' => [
			'email'
		],
		'Comment' => [
			'authorIp',
		],
	];

	/**
	 * Loop through the fields
	 */
	foreach ( $fields_to_require_auth as $type_name => $fields_to_filter ) {

		if ( ! empty( $fields_to_filter ) && is_array( $fields_to_filter ) ) {

			/**
			 * Apply a filter to said Type's fields
			 */
			add_filter( 'graphql_' . $type_name . '_fields', function( $fields ) use ( $type_name, $fields_to_filter ) {

				/**
				 * Loop through each of the fields we want to filter for this Type
				 */
				foreach ( $fields_to_filter as $field_name ) {

					/**
					 * The registry normalizes all keys to lowercase, so we make our $field_name lowercase here too
					 */
					$field_key = strtolower( $field_name );

					/**
					 * Make sure the field exists in the registry (it could have been removed by another plugin)
					 */
					if ( isset( $fields[ $field_key ] ) ) {

						/**
						 * If the request is not authenticated (no current user is set), override the resolver for the field to throw
						 * a UserError
						 *
						 * Change this to whatever condition you want
						 */
						if ( ! get_current_user_id() ) {
							$fields[ $field_key ]['resolve'] = function ( $root, $args, $context, $info ) use ( $type_name, $field_name ) {
								throw new \GraphQL\Error\UserError( __( sprintf( 'You do not have access to view the "%1$s" Field on the %2$s Type', $field_name, $type_name ), 'wp-graphql' ) );
							};
						}
					}
				}

				/**
				 * Return the fields to the filter.
				 */
				return $fields;
			} );
		}
	}

} );
```

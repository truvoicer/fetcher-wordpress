Plugins are a core tenant in every WordPress site. WPGraphQL currently provides a plugins query
to get a list of all site plugins and a plugin query to query a specific plugin by it's ID.

<Note title="Privacy and Access">
Plugins are considered private and require WPGraphQL requests to be authenticated and for the requestor
to have proper capabilities to see the plugins associated with the site. The examples below are
example queries, but the results will not show anything as they are public requests.
</Note>

### Queries

<GraphiQL
  query="{
  plugins {
    nodes {
      id
      authorUri
      pluginUri
      description
      version
      author
    }
  }
}"
/>

<GraphiQL
  query="{
  plugin(id: 1) {
    id
    authorUri
    pluginUri
    description
    version
    author
  }
}"
/>

Plugin queries and mutations are still a work in progress, check out github for more information
on where these features stand:
